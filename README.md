# NodeJS_Mentoring_Program

## Task Completion

### Basics

1. Write a program which reads a string from the standard input stdin, reverses it and then writes it to the standard output stdout.

- The program should be started from npmscript via nodemon(i.e. npm run task1).
- The program should be running in a stand-by mode and should not be terminated after the first-stringprocessing

2. Write a program which should do the following:

- Read the content of csvfile from./csvdirectory. Example: <https://epa.ms/nodejs19-hw1-ex1â€¢Use> the csvtojsonpackage (<https://github.com/Keyang/node-csvtojson>) to convert csvfile to jsonobject.
- Write the csvfile content to a new txtfile.Use the following format: <https://epa.ms/nodejs19-hw1-ex2>.
- Do not load all the content of the csvfile into RAM via stream (read/write file content line by line).
- In case of read/write errors, log them in the console.
- The program should be started via npm scriptusing nodemon(i.e. npm run task2).
